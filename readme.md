# Cube
GameObject based network replication library for [Unity3d](https://unity.com/). Simple network protocol based on eventual consistency (which means nothing is sent reliable and bandwidth is completely scalable).

## Features
- Eventual consistency based network model (loosely based on [GDC Vault: I Shot You First! Gameplay Networking in Halo: Reach](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014345/I-Shot-You-First-Networking))
- Develop server and client at the same time
- Rpcs as normal function calls (using Cecil to patch assemblies)
- Client/server prefabs and ScriptableObjects are discovered automatically, no factory functions to implement or lists to manually maintain
- Transport layer currently either [LiteNetLib](https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib) or [Lidgren](https://github.com/lidgren/lidgren-network-gen3)
- Tooling
- Integration with [Unreal-style gameplay framework](https://github.com/NoDogsInc/GameFramework)

_What problem does this library solve exactly?_
- Replicate a bunch of marked GameObjects (*Replica*s) with marked Components from a server to multiple clients with limited bandwidth with the help of scoping and aggressive priorization. Also takes care of ownership and events (unreliable rpcs).

_Unreliable packets only sounds wasteful_
- Think of it like backed shadowmaps vs realtime shadows. If it fits your bandwidth/cpu budget you can get several advantages by using this model. Note that this kind of network model is mainly useful for dynamic worlds, static elements such a buildings would benefit some being replicated in a seperate way (which you should do anyway)

_Why not use UNet, Mirror, ..._
- Years ago UNet had interesting kinks which we didn't like. The Halo/Tribes network model sounded interesting and it has been simple and hassle free to use. The core of this library has not changed over the years through it has been optimized and tweaked and more tooling has been added.

## Getting Started
Clone the git repository into your **Assets** folder.

### Connecting server and client in editor
Create new GameObject *ClientGame* in the scene and add the *Cube/ClientGame* component.
Create another new GameObject *ServerGame* and add the *Cube/ServerGame* component. 
When you start the game now you should see log output of the client connecting to the server.

Note that the automatic connection to the server in ClientGame is just enabled in the Unity editor.

Now that we've got a connection we can start looking at ...

## Replication

A **Replica** is replicated from the server to all clients. Replicas must always be instances of prefabs for Cube to be able to create client instances of them.


Create a new *GameObject* in the scene. Add the *Cube/Replica* component to mark it as an Replica.
Add the *Cube/ReplicaTransform* component to keep their transforms synchronized.

Then create a prefab *TestReplica* from it by dragging the GameObject into the project explorer. Delete the original instance.

Create a new script TestServerGame:
```C#
using Cube.Networking;
using Cube.Replication;
using Cube.Transport;
using UnityEngine;
using BitStream = Cube.Transport.BitStream;

public class TestServerGame : ServerGame {
	public GameObject prefab;

    protected override void OnNewIncomingConnection(Connection connection, BitStream bs) {
        // Create a new ReplicaView for this Connection
        var view = new GameObject("ReplicaView " + connection);
        view.transform.parent = transform;

        var rw = view.AddComponent<ReplicaView>();
        rw.connection = connection;
        
        server.replicaManager.AddReplicaView(rw);

        // Instantiate some Replica
        server.replicaManager.InstantiateReplica(prefab);
    }
}
```
Replace the *ServerGame* component on the ServerGame scene GameObject. Assign TestReplica to it's prefab field.

A **ReplicaView** observes Replicas for a connection. Its position and settings is used to scope and priorize which Replicas to send. Without a ReplicaView the client will not receive any Replicas.

Start the game now and you should see the Replica prefab being replicated. Try to move around the server-side instance in the editor.

For the client to instantiate a different prefab, rename your prefab to *Server_TestReplica*
and create a new prefab variant *Client_TestReplica* (The name prefixes **Server_** and **Client_** are important). 

#### ReplicaBehaviour instead of MonoBehaviour
ReplicaBehaviour derives from MonoBehaviour and is used to implement multiplayer related functionaly on a Replica.
The server/client members can be used to access the Cube instance the Replica is part of. Rpcs are only available for ReplicaBehaviours.

```C#
using Cube.Replication;
using UnityEngine;

public class Test : ReplicaBehaviour {
    void DoTest() {
        if (!isServer)
            return;

         RpcTest();
    }
    
    [ReplicaRpc(RpcTarget.Client)]
    void RpcTest() {
        Debug.Log("Client rpc called");
    }
}
```

#### Replica ownership
Each Replica has an owning (Replica.owner) connection. Assign ownership with **Replica.AssignOwnership** and take it away with **Replica.TakeOwnership**. Only the server can set and remove ownership. Ownership information is sent to the owning client. 

### ReplicaRpc
ReplicaBehaviours can send **unreliable** rpcs. Rpcs are prioritized aggressively, so never rely on these to transmit actual gameplay state. Instead, these should be used for additional, optional effects and cues. 

Rpcs can only be private functions with an \[ReplicaRpc(...)] attribute and its name starting with Rpc.

```C#
using Cube.Replication;
using UnityEngine;

public class TestReplica : ReplicaBehaviour {
    void Update() {
        if (!isServer)
            return;

        RpcTest();
    }

    [ReplicaRpc(RpcTarget.Client)]
    void RpcTest() {
        Debug.Log("Client rpc called");
    }
}
```
